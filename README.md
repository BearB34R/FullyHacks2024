# Project Overview

This project, named "NeonNews", is a comprehensive exploration of web development fundamentals, focusing on the use of JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Node.js, and Express.js, and deployed on Heroku.

## Goal

The primary goal of this project is to gain a deep understanding of how these technologies interact to create dynamic, interactive web applications.

### JavaScript, HTML & CSS

We aim to master JavaScript, the programming language that powers the web. We'll learn how to manipulate web elements, handle user events, and make AJAX requests to APIs. We'll also delve into modern JavaScript features and best practices. HTML and CSS form the foundation of web development. We'll learn how to use HTML to structure web pages and CSS to style them.

### Node.js & Express.js

Node.js allows us to run JavaScript on the server. We'll learn how to create a server, handle requests and responses, and interact with databases. We'll also explore the vast ecosystem of Node.js modules and learn how to use popular ones like Express.js. Express.js is a minimalist web framework for Node.js.

### News API

We'll pull data from a news API and display it in our application. This will involve making HTTP requests from our server, handling the API's response, and presenting the data in a user-friendly format.

### ChatGPT Integration

We plan to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT to summarize news articles. This will involve making requests to the ChatGPT API and handling the responses.

### NeonUI

We'll use a neon-themed UI to make our application visually striking. This will involve advanced CSS techniques and possibly the use of a CSS framework or library to fit the theme of the hackathon.

# Conclusion

By the end of this project, we aim to have a solid understanding of these technologies and be able to build full-stack web applications from scratch. We'll also have a portfolio piece that demonstrates our skills and learning journey.

edit: we didn't manage to aquire a free news api so the heroku deployment won't work correctly. However the locally run server will.
